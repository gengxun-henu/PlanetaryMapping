# PlanetaryMapping
Planetary Mapping software tools
  This project provides a series of software tools to conduct photogrammetric processing of planetary images. It makes full use of 
existing open source software in GIS community such as GDAL and OpenCV. Currently, the project depends on USGS ISIS to support the .cub 
format planetary images and conduct various photogrammetric operations. The development environment can be easily constructed based on anaconda.
